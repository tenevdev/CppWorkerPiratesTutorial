## Introduction

This [SpatialOS](https://improbable.io/) tutorial branches out of the [Pirates tutorial](https://github.com/spatialos/UnitySDK/blob/master/docs/tutorials/pirates/overview.md)
to show you an alternative way of architecting a SpatialOS game.

To build this project, you will need access to the [SpatialOS SDK](https://spatialos.improbable.io/get-spatialos), and to have set it up on your machine (see the setup guides for [Windows](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/reference/latest/setup-spatialos/win) or [Mac](https://spatialos.improbable.io/docs/reference/latest/setup-spatialos/mac)).

If you run into problems, or want to give us feedback, please visit the [SpatialOS forums](https://forums.improbable.io/).
